    "## Workflow Logic and Design\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a comprehensive end-to-end machine learning pipeline for a text classification task using the \"IMDB Dataset.csv\" dataset. The pipeline includes the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Loading**: Reading and validating the dataset to ensure it is suitable for analysis.\n",
    "2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, preprocessing, and tokenizing the text data to prepare it for feature extraction.\n",
    "3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating features suitable for text classification tasks using techniques like CountVectorizer and TF-IDF.\n",
    "4. **Model Development**: Building and training models, including a baseline logistic regression model and a deep learning model using PyTorch.\n",
    "5. **Evaluation**: Evaluating the models using standard metrics such as accuracy and classification reports.\n",
    "6. **Inference**: Demonstrating predictions on new/unseen data.\n",
    "7. **MLflow Logging and Tracking**: Logging and tracking every step of the pipeline using MLflow for reproducibility and monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Cleaning**: HTML tags and special characters were removed from the text data, and all text was converted to lowercase to standardize the input.\n",
    "- **Feature Extraction**: Both CountVectorizer and TF-IDF were used to create features from the text data. TF-IDF was chosen for model training due to its ability to capture the importance of words in the context of the entire dataset.\n",
    "- **Model Selection**: A logistic regression model was chosen as the baseline due to its simplicity and interpretability. A simple neural network was implemented using PyTorch to leverage the on-prem GPU for deep learning.\n",
    "- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy and classification reports were used to evaluate the models, providing insights into their performance on the test set.\n",
    "- **MLflow Integration**: MLflow was used to log and track experiments, including metrics, models, and artifacts, ensuring reproducibility and easy monitoring of the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "## MLflow Configurations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Experiment Initialization**: The MLflow experiment was initialized with the name \"Text Classification Pipeline\".\n",
    "- **Run Management**: Separate MLflow runs were created for each model and stage of the pipeline, allowing for organized tracking of experiments.\n",
    "- **Logging Metrics and Artifacts**: Metrics such as accuracy and loss were logged for each model. Classification reports and trained models were also logged as artifacts.\n",
    "- **GPU Utilization**: The deep learning model was configured to utilize the on-prem GPU if available, ensuring efficient training.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenges and Resolutions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Imbalance**: The dataset had a balanced distribution of positive and negative reviews, so no additional steps were needed to address data imbalance.\n",
    "- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preprocessing text data can be challenging due to the presence of various special characters and HTML tags. A robust cleaning function was implemented to handle these issues.\n",
    "- **Model Training on GPU**: Ensuring the deep learning model utilized the on-prem GPU required careful configuration and testing. The model was successfully trained on the GPU, significantly reducing training time.\n",
    "- **MLflow Integration**: Integrating MLflow in a secure, on-prem environment required configuring the MLflow tracking server and ensuring all logs and artifacts were stored locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a detailed and reproducible pipeline for text classification using the \"IMDB Dataset.csv\" dataset. By leveraging MLflow for logging and tracking, the pipeline ensures transparency and reproducibility of experiments. The use of both traditional machine learning and deep learning models demonstrates the flexibility and scalability of the pipeline for various text classification tasks.\n",
